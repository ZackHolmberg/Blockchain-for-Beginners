# Blockchain for Beginners
### A dive into blockchain technology for those who know nothing about it (like me, previously).

Paper and sample code included. Paper [here](TermPaper.pdf). An example of a basic python blockchain implementation, specifically an implementation of a cryptocurrency called ZackCoin, is included as part of the paper, located [here](ZackCoin.py). This basic implementation uses many concepts discussed previously in this paper in an effort to further the understanding of blockchain technology. To run this code, ensure you have the python, flask and requests packages installed on your machine ( pip install <packageName>  to install a package within a terminal window). Download the files into a local directory and open up the directory in a terminal window. To run the Flash application, run  python ZackCoin.py . Then in another terminal within the same directory, you can run 
curl localhost:5000/transaction -H "Content-Type: application/json"-d '{"from": "<SomeString>", "to":"<SomeOtherString>", "amount": <SomeNumber>}'
to add a transaction to the network. Additionally, you can run curl localhost:5000/mine to mine a block for the most recent transaction, or if there isnâ€™t one, just a general block. Finally, you can run curl localhost:5000/AllZackCoins to print out the contents of the entire blockchain. Relevant output will be printed for the other two commands as well.
